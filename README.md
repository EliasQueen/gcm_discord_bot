## DEPRECATED: THIS PROJECT IS DEPRECATED
### About
This project is a Discord bot based on Discord.py, built as a management tool for Genshin Impact's deprecated commission cycle system.
The goal of this bot was to act as a tool to maintain a history of the commissions in each player's cycles, giving users the option to mark each commission as completed or not, display a general list of completed or pending commissions, provide an overall status of the current cycle, and more.
